Availability Extension
======================

Similar to Amazon's "This product ships within 24 hours" or "Should ship in 4-5 days", this extension provides two messages for each product that give customers more information on the item's availability.

One message displays when the product (or an individual variant) has zero stock ("Out of stock, ships in 3-4 days", for example) and another when there is 1 or more in stock ("In stock, ships within 24 hours", for example).

Because a product may have some variants in stock and others out of stock, you can setup the product pages to display one of the two messages chosen for the product based on those stock levels.

The store can have numerous messages available for products to use.

To Do
----------------------

* Setup the message table to allow multiple languages
* Consider ways to apply messages to entire blocks (categories, product types, etc) at once to speed administration
